## Introduction

SwiftCart is a feature-rich e-commerce application that combines a high-performance backend (SwiftCart API) with a sleek and responsive frontend (SwiftCart UI). Built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, SwiftCart offers a seamless and customizable solution for online businesses.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** SwiftCart UI, crafted with React, provides an intuitive and modern design for an enhanced shopping experience.
- **MERN Stack Backend:** The SwiftCart API, powered by MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, seamlessly integrates with React for efficient product management, user authentication, and transaction handling.
- **Stripe Integration:** SwiftCart effortlessly connects with Stripe for secure and efficient payment processing.
- **Customization:** Both SwiftCart API and UI are developer-friendly, allowing easy customization to meet specific business requirements.

## Architecture

SwiftCart follows a modular architecture, ensuring a clear separation between the frontend and backend components. The MERN stack, coupled with Stripe integration, forms a robust foundation for handling the complexities of e-commerce.
